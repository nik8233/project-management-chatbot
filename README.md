Teams. Nevertheless, the organizations usually encounter
difficulties with the tracking, tasks, status updates to projects and
producing data-driven, timely decisions. In this effort to fill these
gaps, we propose a clever Project Management Chatbot developed
to help teams with tracking the task proceeding or notifying

implemented and tried in Visual Studio Code, and runs in structured
project datasets. There are four methods of AI-human interaction
incorporated into this chatbot. Models. Joint activity theory model
is the quantitative version of the theory of Joint Activity. So that one
can monitor project progress in a structured way. The rest of the
three models will give qualitative information to better group
performance and decision-making process. Every model has been
brought into effect, performed and measured to gauge on its
effectiveness in real time scenarios in task management. An Internet
user-interface has become available. It is being made so that people
can have an easier way to get into the system, which is being worked
out to be more open to new customers friendly, so that other
members of a team can communicate with the chatbot in real reality
without involving technical knowledge. The chat-bot improves
productivity through automatized status checking of the project
advice, which helps promote a smooth working relationship and a
fruitful one, with effectiveness, task completion. Moreover, the
system is suitable with the United Sustainable Development Goals
(SDG) of the nations, especially Quality Education, Decent Work
and Economic Growth and Through responsible Industry,
